# CSAW_Hack3D_2020

> The Hack3D competition serves to raise awareness and generate discussion in engineering and research communities about security in the additive manufacturing field. In Hack3D’s 2019 Qualifying Round, participants were challenged to reconstruct a corrupted .gcode file, employing skills in graphics programming, file manipulation, and reverse-engineering. In the Final Round, teams competed in hacking an anti-counterfeiting system designed to protect CAD models.

The Hack3D competition is organized by Professor Nikhil Gupta, post-doctoral researcher Hammond Pearce, and student researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. 

This repo is a documentation of the Hack3D 2020 challenge of DC-War-Story from **MNIT Jaipur** who secured the 2nd place.
